IMPORTANT:
There are changes required to run a new version. Please make sure you do the following:
Ask SENSE team to cancel all provisioned services to your Site;
Make sure you update your deployment scripts to use new way to define network devices: https://sdn-sense.github.io/NetControlAnsible.html
Depending on your installation - use to update docker image or restart kubernetes with new configuration.

SiteRM Improvements:
Support VirtualPorts (Fake Ports and is Alias)
Improved SNMP Monitoring and Mac information parsing
Support QoS allowOvercommit flag. Allow siteâ€™s
to control overcommit or not for L3 QoS.
Delta Timing and Overlap check imporvements;
Report Network Status of any configuration (L2,L3,Server Vlan, IP, MTU, QoS). Reporting done inside the model and in Prometheus output.
Report QoS Requests in a Prometheus output.
Allow sites to control allvlans flag - either report all vlans from network/host devices or only controlled ones.
WebUI improvements (delta show, topology map)
Separation of Ansible-templates and simplification for sites to specific controlled devices. Please look documentation here https://sdn-sense.github.io/NetControlAnsible.html - for a new way to configure control of network devices.
Before start docker container (either FE or Agent) check all Certificates, configuration files and make sure they are valid.
FE and Agent use docker volume.
Upgrade osg-ca-certs (Needed to support Incommon V3)

Network Device improvements:
New NOS Support: Cisco Nexus 9 (Support Vlan creation/deletion, IPv4/6 assignment, BGP Configuration)
SONiC: Use `set ipv6 next-hop prefer-global` and not add link-local address in the routing table. This issue is visible only between Cisco and SONiC BGP Peering.
AristaEOS: Catch errors and report back to SiteRM.

Code improvement:
Any new code or modified code - requires to run linter.sh This includes for Python: black, isort, pylint. For yaml - yamllint, For bash - bashlint.

1.1.0
This release includes:
  All:
    Config parameters (for FE/Agent/Ansible) must be in YAML format. No INI format support.
    Gentle stop for all containers (using trap) - so services are stopped nicely (not hard
  Switches:
    FreeRTR Ansible Module and support FreeRTR for visualization (no control support yet)
    Sonic route-map clean up fix. It was not deleting routing maps during cancelation.
    Arista EOS templates updated
    SN3700 - Check for ASN in INT (no str == int comparisons)
  Frontend:
    Compute path between switches using lldp information;
    Multiple Delta's support in single request or from multiple separate Orchestrators;
    IP and Vlan Normalization for diff Ansible modules. (e.g. Dell uses Vlan 3600, Arista wants Vlan3600, FreeRTR - sdn5.3600)
    Add IPv6 Routing information to Model from agents(DTNs).
    Add Version, Name, Sitename to Model.
    HTML GUI Update to fix visualization (normal dates, Desc order to list deltas/models)
    UnitTests for Frontend
    Add RST Ports. (Double split issue)
    Check delta with config and not allow conflicts.
  Agent:
    Apply IPv6 Routing for BGP Requests (if DTN has IPv6 in range of BGP Requested override, it will add specific rules to redirect traffic to mavlan)
    Use new formatting for defining vlan_range and ip4/6 list
    RuleDB Check just IP without Range (no multitime apply of rules)
    Formatting 'f' use in ip rule commands, QoS fix (either list or str for IP range)
