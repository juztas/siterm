SiteRM Improvements:
SiteRM Helm charts updates (0.1.46):
  * Release for Frontend deployment Helm chart.
  * Liveness/Readiness/Test probes added to the Helm charts. In case of issues with SiteRM Frontend/Agent - pods will be restarted.
  * Use of predefined image tags for Frontend/Agent - based on latest stable release;
  * Allow to control CPU/Mem Requests/Limits for Frontend/Agent pods.
  * Allow adding nodeAffinity for Frontend/Agent pods via helm values.yaml.
  * Minimized helm charts for Frontend/Agent (without including previous versions of the charts).
  * Agent Helm chart requires ClusterRole/ClusterRoleBinding for the agent to work properly. Permissions needed: apiGroups: [""], resources: ["nodes"], verbs: ["get", "list"]. If using official Helm charts it will apply automatically.
SiteRM Frontend updates:
  * (Beta) Metadata Service to expose metadata information about the SiteRM services, e.g. Kuberenetes isAlias and Multus;
  * Allow adding SiteRM agent without Switch control via Kubernetes label isAlias: <name>. It can connect to any other NSI domain URN.
  * Support for ssh_common_args in ansible configuration. This allows to set the ssh options for all ansible connections.
  * Full rewrite of LookupService. In case there are multiple devices at Site, each device for retrieving configuration or applying will use a separate thread.
  * LookupService rewrite stability improvements and better error handling, reporting in the logs, web ui.
  * Fix allowed vlan check at global level and or port level (depending on Site's configuration).
  * New ServiceState page to view the state of all SiteRM services. Can be seen under https://<url>/servicestates.html
  * Moved to pip3 installation for SiteRM Frontend and Agent. (PEP420)
  * Docker auto restart and healthcheck for Frontend and agent. In case of issues, the container will be restarted.
  * Support querying IPv6 SNMP Endpoints.
  * Allow to specify external SNMP exporter url for SNMP monitoring.
  * Fix ARP information reporting (in case of multiple entries under the switch)
  * soft-reconfiguration added for BGP peering.
  * API to allow re-add delta to the model. (only if the delta is in one of the final states)
  * No restarts every hour for configuration changes. Restart of services will happen every hour only if there are changes in the configuration on git.
  * Ansible retries in case of communication failures. (default 3 times, after which activate-error is reported).
  * Support for Kubernetes yaml apply installation dropped. Please use HELM Charts for Frontend/Agent installation.
