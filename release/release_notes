This release includes:
  All:
    Config parameters (for FE/Agent/Ansible) must be in YAML format. No INI format support.
    Gentle stop for all containers (using trap) - so services are stopped nicely (not hard
  Switches:
    FreeRTR Ansible Module and support FreeRTR for visualization (no control support yet)
    Sonic route-map clean up fix. It was not deleting routing maps during cancelation.
    Arista EOS templates updated
    SN3700 - Check for ASN in INT (no str == int comparisons)
  Frontend:
    Compute path between switches using lldp information;
    Multiple Delta's support in single request or from multiple separate Orchestrators;
    IP and Vlan Normalization for diff Ansible modules. (e.g. Dell uses Vlan 3600, Arista wants Vlan3600, FreeRTR - sdn5.3600)
    Add IPv6 Routing information to Model from agents(DTNs).
    Add Version, Name, Sitename to Model.
    HTML GUI Update to fix visualization (normal dates, Desc order to list deltas/models)
    UnitTests for Frontend
    Add RST Ports. (Double split issue)
    Check delta with config and not allow conflicts.
  Agent:
    Apply IPv6 Routing for BGP Requests (if DTN has IPv6 in range of BGP Requested override, it will add specific rules to redirect traffic to mavlan)
    Use new formatting for defining vlan_range and ip4/6 list
    RuleDB Check just IP without Range (no multitime apply of rules)
    Formatting 'f' use in ip rule commands, QoS fix (either list or str for IP range)
