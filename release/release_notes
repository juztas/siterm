This release includes (highlight main items):

IMPORTANT:
There are changes required to run a new version. Please make sure you do the following:
Ask the SENSE team to cancel all provisioned services to your Site.
Modify Configuration Files for a new release. See the 'Changes needed' section.
Depending on your installation - update the docker image or restart Kubernetes with a new release.

Changes needed:
1. (Frontend) Port naming changed. Ports in the configuration are now listed without special character changes. Old way:
```
  ports:
    - "Ethernet1/49"
    - "Ethernet1/51"
    - "Ethernet1/52"
  port_Ethernet1-49_capacity: 100000
  port_Ethernet1-49_desttype: switch
  port_Ethernet1-49_isAlias: "isAliasLink"
  port_Ethernet1-49_wanlink: "Ethernet1/49"
```
New way:
```
  ports:
    "Ethernet1/49":
        "capacity": 100000
        "desttype": switch
        "isAlias": "isAlias"
        "wanlink": true
    "Ethernet1/51": {}
    "Ethernet1/52": {}
```
2. (Agent) Agents will use Bandwidth Parameters from the configuration. Old way:
```
  intf_max: 40000
  max_bandwidth: 40000
  min_bandwidth: 1000
```
New way:
```
  bwParams:
    unit: mbps # Unit type
    type: guaranteedCapped | bestEffort # Indicates type for Bandwidth Service
    priority: 0 # Indicates priority compared to other interfaces
    reservableCapacity: <0%-100%> # (Optional) Reservable capacity for siterm on that interface (Default 100%)
    minReservableCapacity: <VAL_IN_UNIT> # Indicates minimum Reservable Capacity (1G suggested, no default)
    maximumCapacity: <VAL_IN_UNIT> # Indicates maximum Capacity of interface
    granularity: <VAL_IN_UNIT> # Indicates granularity
    reservableCapacity: <0%-100%> # (Optional) Reservable capacity for all siterm interfaces (Default 100%)
```
3. (Frontend) Allows to control reservable Capacity under port/device. This can be set with the parameter `reservableCapacity` either under the device or port. It must be a percentage: <0%-100%> (Default 100%).


SiteRM Improvements:
SiteRM Agent Moved to HELM deployment. See here for details: https://sdn-sense.github.io/Installation.html
Web UI allows us to see the state of all SiteRM services. Can be seen under https://<url>/servicestates.html
Web UI allows to refresh configuration, and or delete hosts from SiteRM's database.
Report NetworkStatus with data plane type status inside the model. This allows Orchestrator/Admins/Users to identify and know dataplane activation status.
Report NetworkStatus with data-plane type status inside Prometheus output. New dashboards (under each site) deployed here: https://autogole-grafana.nrp-nautilus.io, which allows you to see the status of the data plane over time.
Report BandwidthService requests inside Prometheus output. New dashboards (under each site) are available here: https://autogole-grafana.nrp-nautilus.io
Support multiple lifetime scheduling requests for non-overlapping times, but the same VLANs or IP ranges.
New APIs, which allow to deletion of old Debug calls, hosts, network devices.
Routing information (received from Network devices) was removed from the model.
A New Service, DBCleaner added to cleanup database of old entries.
Any request is checked for conflicts. Checks are done: vlan overlap, ip overlap, bandwidth exceeding availability.
The Debugger Service was rewritten to use threading (non-blocking execution). This allows to run multiple Debug services at the same time.
Frontend introduced a new Debug service (still beta) with an idea to allow issue ping/traceroute from network devices for debugging purposes. (Expected in next release)
Default txqueulen/mtu same as the master interface, if not specified in the agent configuration.
If the port is not switchport type - it will be ignored by SiteRM and will not be added to the model.
Allow to control site which VLANs to put inside model. Parameter `allvlans: True|False` indicates if the device should model all VLANs or only SENSE VLANs inside the model; (Default False)
Docker/Podman startup script updates: check certificates and configuration files for validity.
Documentation for all SiteRM Frontend and Agent parameters. See https://sdn-sense.github.io/Configuration.html


Network Device improvements:
(ALL) Implement functionwrapper/classwrapper with verbose logging (log timings, function parameters, output).
(ALL) Separate VLAN and BGP apply in separate calls. Change order for VLAN/BGP Configuration. Order is now: VLAN, PREFIX-LIST, ROUTE-MAP, BGP.
(ALL) New feature to allow split any commands on device (if needed). This is controlled by ansible templates (used for now only by Dell OS 10)
(SONiC,DellOS9) Enabled soft-reconfiguration for peering.
(SONiC) Fix byte/str/int - diff versions of SONiC Release Python output returns either bytes/str/int for ASN Number.
(SONiC) VRF Support.
(SONiC) Retry any SONiC command in case of failure (up to 3 times). Visible if 2 modifications happen at the same time.
(Arista EOS) Older Arista EOS Bandwidth reporting fixed.
(Dell OS 10) VRF Support, BGP Fix, split prefix-list creation.
(Dell OS9)(Beta feature) Support traffic police, based on service request if `rate_limit: True|False` is set under device port. (Default False)

Supported systems: x86_64 and ppc64le(beta)
